# Color Transfer

## Getting Started

The `color_transfer.hpp` header file is an OpenCV implementation based on [Color Transfer
between Images](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/946629/) [Reinhard et al., 2001] and [Adrian Rosebrock repository](https://github.com/jrosebr1/color_transfer) (for Python). The algorithm requires only the mean and standard deviation of pixel intensities for each channel in the L*a*b* color space.

This is an C++ approach from the above methods, for more information I recommend the above article or [Adrian's post on his blog](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/06/30/super-fast-color-transfer-images/).


### Requirements

* OpenCV
* boost/program_options*

*Optional - Used to get the input images from terminal


### Installing

Just download this repository and use the header file `color_transfer.hpp` contained in the color_transfer folder.


## Running the tests

A example is in sample folder. After compiling it, run the code below

<code>$ ./color_transfer -s ../images/sunset.jpg -t ../images/ocean_day.jpg</code>
